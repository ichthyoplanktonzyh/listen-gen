# listen-gen

`listen-gen` is the heavy, replaceable production side of Listen. Its stable
output is a content package consumed by `listen-core`; model runtimes and raw
provider payloads are not part of that interface.

Project terminology is defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). Read
[`ECOSYSTEM.md`](ECOSYSTEM.md) for the shared product architecture, repository
boundaries, accepted invariants, and current implementation status.

The production entry point transcribes media behind a provider-neutral ASR
adapter and writes native v1 `subtitle_text_track` and `word_timeline`
resources. The offline fixture provider exercises the full CLI without model
credentials or network access:

```bash
python -m listen_gen package from-media input.wav \
  --provider fixture --fixture normalized-asr.json \
  --title "Lesson" --media-kind audio --duration-ms 2200 \
  --created-at-ms 1785542400000 --output lesson.listenpkg
```

## Machine orchestration protocol

The default CLI output remains one JSON result for compatibility. App and
other supervisors can opt into a versioned NDJSON stream by adding
`--machine-events` to either package command. Every line has schema
`listen_gen.machine-event.v1`, `protocol_version: 1`, a zero-based monotonic
`sequence`, and the listen-gen tool identity/version.

The stream contains one `protocol` header, exactly one `started` event, zero or
more named `phase` events, and exactly one `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`
terminal event. Phases include `validating`, `probing_media`,
`normalizing_audio`, `transcribing`, and `building_package`; the protocol does
not invent percentage progress.

The `completed` event directly contains a `sha256:` package digest, resource
inventory, warnings, and the original-media fingerprint for native generation.
It does not echo the local output path. Failures use stable categories:
`invalid_input`, `media_probe_failed`, `audio_preprocessing_failed`,
`provider_failed`, `package_write_failed`, and `internal_error`. Provider
stdout/stderr, raw responses, command arguments, and local paths are excluded.

SIGINT and SIGTERM produce a `cancelled` terminal event and exit with 130 and
143 respectively. An in-flight ffprobe, ffmpeg, or provider wrapper is run in
its own process group, and cancellation kills that entire group before
temporary normalized audio and incomplete package files are removed.

`normalized-asr.json` is the provider-neutral boundary: it contains timed
segments and word character spans, plus versioned provider/model provenance.
Production provider adapters can be added behind the same interface without
changing the resource package contract. Explicit creation time and media
metadata make fixture and replay builds deterministic.

For actual media, `command` first uses `ffprobe` to identify audio streams and
`ffmpeg` to create a temporary 16 kHz mono signed-16-bit PCM WAV. It then runs
the local provider wrapper as a direct argv subprocess (never through a shell).
Put the exact `{media}` placeholder in one argument; that placeholder receives
the normalized temporary WAV, not the original container. The wrapper must
write a normalized `listen_gen.asr-result.v1` document to stdout:

```bash
python -m listen_gen package from-media input.mp4 \
  --provider command --command /opt/listen/bin/whisper-wrapper \
  --command-arg transcribe --command-arg '{media}' \
  --command-arg=--model --command-arg large-v3 \
  --audio-stream-index 1 \
  --command-timeout-seconds 3600 \
  --title "Lesson" --media-kind video --duration-ms 125000 \
  --created-at-ms 1785542400000 --output lesson.listenpkg
```

A media file with exactly one audio stream is selected automatically. If it
has multiple audio streams, `--audio-stream-index` is mandatory and refers to
the container stream index reported by `ffprobe`. `--ffprobe-command`,
`--ffmpeg-command`, and `--media-command-timeout-seconds` can select managed
tool installations and set the preprocessing deadline. Temporary audio is
removed after success, provider failure, or timeout. Timeouts terminate the
subprocess group; probe output is capped at 1 MiB and normalized ASR JSON at
16 MiB.

Whisper, hosted ASR, and other provider-specific decoding belongs inside that
wrapper. Non-zero exit, timeout, startup failure, and invalid JSON errors do
not echo provider stdout/stderr, raw responses, or command arguments.

The LLTimeline command is migration compatibility only:

```bash
python -m listen_gen package from-lltimeline input.lltimeline.json \
  --output lesson.listenpkg
```

That command selects the active word, phone, and sense-group resources, converts
the known `rhythm_word_acoustic_cues` artifact, and writes a deterministic ZIP.
Local paths, Core lifecycle state, and unknown artifact payloads are excluded.
Warnings are printed in the JSON command result.

The v1 package carries generated resources, not media bytes. Its content
document retains the SHA-256 of the original media bytes (not the temporary
normalized audio), so Core can attach the package to matching local media.
Local paths and subprocess output are never included. Entries use ZIP `STORE`;
each resource identity is the SHA-256 of its exact raw JSON bytes.
Resource provenance configuration combines the provider wrapper's declared
configuration identity with a stable description of the selected audio stream,
adapter protocol, and normalization format; executable and temporary paths are
excluded. Package files are completed and synced beside the destination before
an atomic replacement, so a failed build does not truncate an existing package.

## Contract authority

The canonical schema is owned by `listen-core` at
`contracts/content-package/v1`. `contracts.lock.json` pins the exact Core
commit and SHA-256 of both authoritative JSON schemas.
This repository does not carry a schema copy.

## Development

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

No model credentials or live services are used by these tests. To also send
the generated fixture package through Core's Rust inspector, explicitly point
the suite at a checkout:

```bash
LISTEN_CORE_CHECKOUT=/path/to/listen-core \
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
